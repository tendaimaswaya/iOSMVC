# iOSMVC
 
Issues:
1. Dependency injection on the homeViewModel in HomeViewController should be implemented but due to the fact i was instantiating this view from the storyboard, i chose the alternative
2. Network call failure handling is not exhaustive - it mainly caters for request timeouts
3. There are implementations i feel can be done better e.g for the selectedCell in HomeViewController when a user clicks on a TableView cell.
