# CodeChallenge
 
Considerations:

1. I have tried to work on this in intervals but overaly under 8 hours as Tim highlighted and this is what i could do in the given period.
2. I have implemented the UI for the HomeViewController via code and that of the DetailsViewController mainly via the Storyboard - this was in order to try and demonstrate the little knowledge i have for both

Issues:
1. Dependency injection on the homeViewModel in HomeViewController should be implemented but due to the fact i was instantiating this view from the storyboard, i chose the alternative
2. Network call failure handling is not exhaustive - it mainly caters for request timeouts
3. There are implementations i feel can be done better e.g for the selectedCell in HomeViewController when a user clicks on a TableView cell.
